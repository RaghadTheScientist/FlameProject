# Flame Coffee Shop Database System

The project is a comprehensive database management system developed for a coffee shop named “Flame”. Built as part of the CSC380 course team project, it aims to streamline daily operations within the shop by supporting two main user roles: Cashiers and Food Preparers.

The system allows Cashiers to handle customer orders, generate invoices, and manage payments, while Food Preparers process these orders, update their preparation status, and manage menu items. It utilizes Java for the user interface and JDBC for database connectivity, ensuring a dynamic and interactive experience.

## Key Features:

  •	Role-specific access for Cashiers and Food Preparers.
  
  •	Invoice management including item selection, order type, and payment method.

 •	Real-time updates on invoice completion.
	
 •	Ability to add, update, and retrieve employee and item information.
	
 •	GUI interface with error handling and validation (e.g., phone number length).

 •	Filtered invoice views based on completion status.

The project encapsulates the core functionalities needed for a real-world café setting and demonstrates the practical application of database design, ER modeling, SQL operations, and GUI development in Java.
